I’m the Head of Bioinformatics at the [Quadram Institute Bioscience](https://www.quadram.ac.uk),
with an interest in reproducible and scalable pipelines and microbial (meta)genomics data analysis.

I pursued a PhD in Biochemistry and Biotechnology, focusing on bioinformatics applications for Next Generation Sequencing since the field’s advent. In Italy, I led the bioinformatics activities of a sequencing provider (BMR Genomics), moving to the UK in 2017 to join the Core Bioinformatics team at this Institute.

## Research interests

I have been working on microbial genomics since my MSc, where I analysed microarray data to study the transcriptional landscape
of *Photobacterium profundum* SS9, a deep-seq bacterium.

I later gained interest in the **microbiome** and, in particular, in the methodologies to ensure reproducible and accurate
analysis of amplicon and whole metagenome sequencing datasets.

## Open source and development

I mostly program in Python, but I have developed a special interest in Nim, a compiled and memory safe language, and
I chose [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io) as the main workflow manager for our pipelines.

I developed some bioinformatic tools, such as [SeqFu](https://telatin.github.io/seqfu2) and [BamToCov](https://telatin.github.io/bamtocov), and pipelines for microbial genomics, such as [Dadaist2](https://quadram-institute-bioscience.github.io/dadaist2).

I’m a contributor to the [Bioconda](https://bioconda.github.io) and [nf-core](https://nf-co.re) projects.
