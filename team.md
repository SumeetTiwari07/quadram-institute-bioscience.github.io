# Meet The Team

Core Bioinformatics maintains both hardware and software infrastructure to support the research in microbial genomics.
To ensure the reproducibility and traceability of our experiments, we have a dedicated sequencing output archival system based on [IRIDA](https://irida.ca/), we maintain a [Galaxy Project](https://www.galaxyproject.org) instance (and we added several tools to the Galaxy Toolshed), and a private cloud based on OpenNebula.
